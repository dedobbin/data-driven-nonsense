# data-driven-nonsense

Abondoned project to experiment/learn more about
- Smart pointers
- Data-driven design
- Decoupling through observers

Conclusions:
- Smart pointers are nice and i should get better at using them
- I don't have the context and time to hobby out a library/game with this kind of design
- Because of the approach i took, components shadow properties. This is bad
